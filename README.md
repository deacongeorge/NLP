# NLP Natural language processing Topic modelling.
A topic model identifies similar words in a text and put them under one topic.
The most dominant topic in the text which indicates what the text is primarily about are then identifed.
Topic Modeling helps to comprehend a large body of text and useful technique for extracting topics and obtain the hidden concepts
or topics behind the words.

Topic modelling is applied in arranging similar documents together by discovering abstract topics to organise the large volume of texts.
Topic modeling is also used in search engines wherein the search string is matched with the results of topic model.

In this excercise to extract features from text, two Topic models have been created using LSA and LDA also sentiment features (polarity and subjectivity) have been extracted using textblob.

A topic model was created using LSA (Latent semantic analysis) which is based on singular value decomposition (SVD) 
Also LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) which is a generative probabilistic model for a given corpus was created
